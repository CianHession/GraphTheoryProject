# Graph Theory Project - G00379799 - Cian Hession
# Purpose of this repository?
This repository is being used to store my Graph Theory Project and will contain many commits as I progress through the module. It will contain 2 notebooks, a Heap-Sort notebook aswell as a Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook, aswell as this README.md file, in which I will provide information of what the contents contain of the notebooks. I will also provide easy to follow instructions for you to be able to run these notebooks yourself.

# Requirements to run the notebooks
In order to run these notebooks, you will need a few things.
The first thing you need to install is Python, I would highly recommend using Anaconda, which you can get here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution the installation process will take around 5 minutes.

Next you will need to install GIT, as this will allow you to clone this repository to your machine and easily run commands, you can download git from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Finally, this one is optional, you will need CMDer, cmder is a more fleshed out command prompt than your standard windows provided version, however like stated, is not a requisite to run the notebooks. You can find the download of CMDer on SourceForge as it appears the original website is no longer online.
